# Testerium - Language Switcher Testing Log

## Current Status: ‚úÖ FIXED
Language switching is now working properly after fixing critical path and initialization issues.

## What Hasn't Worked So Far:

### 1. Dynamic Language Switcher Creation ‚ùå
- **Attempt**: Creating language switcher dynamically in JavaScript
- **Issue**: Switcher wasn't appearing at all
- **Result**: Failed - switcher not visible

### 2. Fixed Positioning with High Z-Index ‚ùå
- **Attempt**: Using `position: fixed` with `z-index: 9999`
- **Issue**: Still not visible
- **Result**: Failed - switcher not appearing

### 3. Multiple Insertion Points ‚ùå
- **Attempt**: Trying to insert switcher into header, then body as fallback
- **Issue**: Switcher creation was unreliable
- **Result**: Failed - inconsistent behavior

### 4. Static HTML Language Switcher ‚úÖ
- **Attempt**: Adding language switcher directly to HTML structure
- **Issue**: None
- **Result**: SUCCESS - flags are now visible

### 5. Async/Await Implementation ‚ùå
- **Attempt**: Making init() and switchLanguage() methods async
- **Issue**: Language switching still doesn't work
- **Result**: Failed - translations not loading or applying

### 6. Enhanced Error Handling ‚ùå
- **Attempt**: Adding comprehensive error handling and debugging
- **Issue**: Still not working despite debugging
- **Result**: Failed - need to investigate further

### 7. Simplified Test Implementation üîç
- **Attempt**: Created test-i18n.html with simplified i18n class
- **Purpose**: Isolate the issue from complex URL handling and async operations
- **Status**: Testing in progress

### 8. Simplified i18n.js Implementation ‚ùå
- **Attempt**: Removed complex URL handling, simplified switchLanguage()
- **Issue**: Multiple problems identified:
  - Finnish flag always stays active (gold)
  - Desktop flags don't stay gold when clicked
  - Language content doesn't change on mobile or PC
- **Result**: Failed - active state and translation issues

## ‚úÖ CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

### 9. Path Correction Fix ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: i18n.js was trying to fetch from `/translations/` (absolute path) instead of `translations/` (relative path)
- **Fix**: Changed fetch path from `/translations/${this.currentLang}.json` to `translations/${this.currentLang}.json`
- **Result**: SUCCESS - translation files now load properly

### 10. Active State Initialization Fix ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: Finnish flag had hardcoded `active` class in HTML, preventing proper state management
- **Fix**: Removed hardcoded `active` class from HTML, let JavaScript manage active states
- **Result**: SUCCESS - active states now work correctly

### 11. Test File Path Fix ‚úÖ
- **Problem**: test-i18n.html also had incorrect fetch path
- **Fix**: Updated test file to use correct relative path
- **Result**: SUCCESS - test file now works properly

## Root Cause Analysis:

The main issues preventing language switching were:

1. **Incorrect Fetch Path**: The absolute path `/translations/` was causing 404 errors, so no translations were loaded
2. **Hardcoded Active State**: The Finnish flag had `active` class hardcoded in HTML, preventing proper state management
3. **Translation Loading Failure**: Due to path issues, fallback translations were being used instead of actual JSON files

## Current Status: ‚úÖ WORKING

Language switching now works correctly:
- ‚úÖ Flags are visible on index page only
- ‚úÖ Clicking flags changes language properly
- ‚úÖ Active state (gold highlighting) works correctly
- ‚úÖ Translations load from JSON files
- ‚úÖ Language persists across page reloads
- ‚úÖ Works on both mobile and desktop

## Test Results:

### Index Page:
- ‚úÖ Finnish flag shows as active by default
- ‚úÖ Clicking other flags changes active state
- ‚úÖ Page content translates correctly
- ‚úÖ Language persists in localStorage

### Subpages (contact.html, gdt.html, intelligentleman.html):
- ‚úÖ No flags visible (as intended)
- ‚úÖ Content still translatable via i18n system
- ‚úÖ Language preference maintained from index page

## Environment Details:
- Files: index.html, contact.html, gdt.html, intelligentleman.html
- Translation files: translations/fi.json, en.json, de.json, fr.json
- Script: i18n.js (FIXED)
- CSS: styles.css
- Test file: test-i18n.html (FIXED)

## Last Updated: [Current Date] - Language switching now fully functional
