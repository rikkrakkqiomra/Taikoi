# Testerium - Language Switcher Testing Log

## Current Status: üîç DEBUGGING
Language flags are visible but have multiple issues preventing proper functionality.

## What Hasn't Worked So Far:

### 1. Dynamic Language Switcher Creation ‚ùå
- **Attempt**: Creating language switcher dynamically in JavaScript
- **Issue**: Switcher wasn't appearing at all
- **Result**: Failed - switcher not visible

### 2. Fixed Positioning with High Z-Index ‚ùå
- **Attempt**: Using `position: fixed` with `z-index: 9999`
- **Issue**: Still not visible
- **Result**: Failed - switcher not appearing

### 3. Multiple Insertion Points ‚ùå
- **Attempt**: Trying to insert switcher into header, then body as fallback
- **Issue**: Switcher creation was unreliable
- **Result**: Failed - inconsistent behavior

### 4. Static HTML Language Switcher ‚úÖ
- **Attempt**: Adding language switcher directly to HTML structure
- **Issue**: None
- **Result**: SUCCESS - flags are now visible

### 5. Async/Await Implementation ‚ùå
- **Attempt**: Making init() and switchLanguage() methods async
- **Issue**: Language switching still doesn't work
- **Result**: Failed - translations not loading or applying

### 6. Enhanced Error Handling ‚ùå
- **Attempt**: Adding comprehensive error handling and debugging
- **Issue**: Still not working despite debugging
- **Result**: Failed - need to investigate further

### 7. Simplified Test Implementation üîç
- **Attempt**: Created test-i18n.html with simplified i18n class
- **Purpose**: Isolate the issue from complex URL handling and async operations
- **Status**: Testing in progress

### 8. Simplified i18n.js Implementation ‚ùå
- **Attempt**: Removed complex URL handling, simplified switchLanguage()
- **Issue**: Multiple problems identified:
  - Finnish flag always stays active (gold)
  - Desktop flags don't stay gold when clicked
  - Language content doesn't change on mobile or PC
- **Result**: Failed - active state and translation issues

## Current Issues Identified:

1. **Active State Bug**: Finnish flag always stays gold, other flags don't maintain active state
2. **CSS Active State**: Desktop flags don't show active state properly
3. **Translation Loading**: May be failing to load translation files
4. **Event Listeners**: May not be properly attached to flag buttons
5. **DOM Updates**: May not be updating page content after language switch

## Next Steps to Try:

1. **Fix Active State Logic**: Ensure proper button state management
2. **Debug Translation Loading**: Check if translation files are accessible
3. **Test Event Listeners**: Verify click events are working
4. **Check CSS Active States**: Ensure .active class styling works on all devices

## Test Files Created:
- `test-i18n.html` - Simplified i18n test with debug info

## Environment Details:
- Files: index.html, contact.html, gdt.html, intelligentleman.html
- Translation files: translations/fi.json, en.json, de.json, fr.json
- Script: i18n.js
- CSS: styles.css
- Test file: test-i18n.html
